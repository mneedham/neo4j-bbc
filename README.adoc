= BBC Champions League Graph

This project takes us from BBC live text commentary for Champions League 2014/2015 matches to a Neo4j graph containing the events of each match.

== Quick start

* Install the latest version of Neo4j from http://neo4j.com/download/
* Windows users: Install desktop application & then click the 'start' button
* Mac/Linux: Unpack the tarball & then `./bin/neo4j start`

Import the data into Neo4j:

[source, bash]
----
cd neo4j-community-2.2.2
./bin/neo4j-shell --file import.cql
----

Open http://localhost:7474 and you're good to go

== Working with the data

If you want to play with the raw data you'll first need to setup a Python environment.

Install link:https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/[virtualenv]  and create a sandbox for this project:

[source, bash]

Download all the matches:

Generate the CSV files that we import into Neo4j:

[source, bash]

----


[source, bash]
